class Parser:
  """
  Reads and parses twineable documents into a list of
  :class:`Chunk <pytwine.core.Chunk>`\\ s.

  Has a concept of a **code block marker**, i.e. something like
  markdown's backtick fenced code blocks::

    ```

  or tilde fenced code blocks::

    ~~~


  Code blocks are considered to start on the line where
  the code block marker begins, and end on the line of their
  end marker.

  Empty blocks, and code blocks containing only whitespace,
  are skipped.

  Code blocks can have pandoc-style **options**. e.g. for a Markdown
  document, the options would be given like so::

    ```python .important startLine=101 animal="spotted lynx"

  where dot gives a class and the ``=`` gives attributes.

  The Parser doesn't parse or process options at all, but just stores
  the whole unparsed start-of-block line in the
  ``block_start_line`` attribute
  of the :class:`CodeChunk <pytwine.core.CodeChunk>`;
  it's up to Processor classes to parse and potentially
  make use of the options.

  Only subclass so far is :class:`MarkdownParser`.

  Subclasses should override :meth:`_is_codeblock_start` and
  :meth:`_is_codeblock_end` (see the code for details).

  **sample usage:**

  sample usage using :class:`MarkdownParser` subclass:

  >>> parser = MarkdownParser(string="some stuff")
  >>> chunks = parser.parse()
  >>> chunks
